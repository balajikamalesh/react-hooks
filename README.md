A Quick walkthrough of all React Hooks:
- useState (to manage state in Components)
- useEffect (to introduce side effects)
- useContext (to consume context)
- useRef
- useReducer (one reducer that handles all the state updates based on an action type)
- useMemo (memoizes expensive function calls so they only are re-evaluated when needed)
- useCallback (return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed)
- useLayoutEffect (similar to useEffect but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations)
- useImperativeHandle (allows you to determine which properties will be exposed on a ref. Used along with useRef)
